## 1. Intorduction

The Class List is a series of functions to manipulate linked-list with all its methods, which you could use in the list from std.
This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos.
By building this, we want to see how works a class and all its methods developing them by ourselves.

## 2. The Algorithms

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at `projeto_ED_list.pdf` file.

## 3. Compilling

To compile this project, you need to:

`open your terminal`

`open the directory containing the folder List-Abstract-Data-Type`

`make`

`./bin/exe`

## 4. Documentation

To access Doxygen documentation, you must go to:

`folder List-Abstract-Data-Type`

`List-Abstract-Data-Type/docs/html`

search for archive:

`index.html`

and there you have it!

## 5. Authorship

This C++ class was developed by Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho and Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso.

\subsection*{1. Intorduction}

The Class List is a series of functions to manipulate linked-\/list with all its methods, which you could use in the list from std. This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos. By building this, we want to see how works a class and all its methods developing them by ourselves.

\subsection*{2. The Algorithms}

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at {\ttfamily projeto\+\_\+\+E\+D\+\_\+list.\+pdf} file.

\subsection*{3. Compilling}

To compile this project, you need to\+:

{\ttfamily open your terminal}

{\ttfamily open the directory containing the folder List-\/\+Abstract-\/\+Data-\/\+Type}

{\ttfamily make}

{\ttfamily ./bin/exe}

\subsection*{4. Documentation}

To access Doxygen documentation, you must go to\+:

{\ttfamily folder List-\/\+Abstract-\/\+Data-\/\+Type}

{\ttfamily List-\/\+Abstract-\/\+Data-\/\+Type/docs/html}

search for archive\+:

{\ttfamily index.\+html}

and there you have it!

\subsection*{5. Authorship}

This C++ class was developed by Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho and Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso.
